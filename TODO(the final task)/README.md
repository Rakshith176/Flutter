##General info
This is a todo app with a calendar view which makes it easier for the user to set their events by just clicking on the desired date on the calendar...
The user can add, edit, delete their tasks on thier preference with no limitations on the number of tasks..


##Installation
Run the following code in the command line in your prefered location:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rakshith176/Rakshith.H.R_IRIS_2020.git
```
and follow the flutter set up documentation [Get started with flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
once your done with setting flutter on your device use the files that you cloned to start using the app


##How it works??
The idea used to design this app was mapping the list of elements with a particular date and displaying them when that date was clicked...
The flutter calendar package is used for displaying and accessing the the calendar..
The **_events** is a map that maps Date and its respected events that are added in it...
Everytime the user clicks a date in the calendar(which is present on the screen all the time) user can add the events to that respected date and the events for the date is displayed when the date is clicked..
